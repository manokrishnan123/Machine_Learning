**LSTM Text Prediction**
1. Data Collection - The dataset used is the text of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. This text offers a rich and complex language structure, providing an ideal challenge for training a predictive model.

2. Data Preprocessing
    a. The text is tokenized to convert words into numerical indices.
    b. Sequences of fixed length are created and padded to ensure uniform input sizes.
    c. The prepared sequences are split into training and testing datasets for model development and evaluation.

3. Model Building - The LSTM model is constructed with the following components:
    a. An embedding layer for learning word representations.
    b. Two LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in the text.
    c. A dense output layer with softmax activation to predict the probability distribution of the next word.

4. Model Training
    a. The model is trained on the prepared sequences.
    b. Early stopping is implemented to monitor validation loss and halt training if the model stops improving. This prevents overfitting and ensures optimal performance.

5. Model Evaluation - The trained model is tested on example sentences to assess its ability to accurately predict the next word. This evaluation demonstrates the model’s understanding of the patterns in the text.
